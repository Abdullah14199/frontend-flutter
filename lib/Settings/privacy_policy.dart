  String Privacy = """Overview and scope
Skep Solutions Corp., a private Canadian federal corporation, having its offices at 1487
Spring Garden Court, Mississauga, ON, L5N 8K7 ("Skep") recognizes the importance of an
individual's right to privacy and is committed to protecting the personal information that
it collects, uses and discloses in providing investment advisory services and operating
its business. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") applies to users of Skep's services
anywhere [in Ontario Canada], including users of Skep's apps, website ("Website" and
"site"), features or other services. This Privacy Policy outlines how Skep collects and
uses personal information of users to provide its services, including how it safeguards
the privacy of such users. This policy also applies to those who provide information to
Skep in connection with an application to use our services, or whose information Skep
otherwise receives in connection with its services. All those subject to this policy are
referred to as "users" or "you" for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information about Skep employment candidates
or Skep employees, partners, or contracted staff, which is dealt with separately. If you apply to
Skep for a job, Skep will need to consider your personal information as part of its application
review process. Skep normally retains information from candidates after a decision has
been made, unless you ask Skep not to retain the information. If Skep offers you a job,
which you accept, the information will be retained in accordance with Skep's privacy
procedures for employee records.
Privacy rights and accountability
All Ontario businesses engaged in commercial activities must comply with Canada's
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ("PIPEDA"). PIPEDA gives
you rights concerning the privacy of your personal information. Skep is responsible for
the personal information it collects and holds. To ensure this accountability, Skep has
developed this Privacy Policy and has trained its partners and employees in respect of it.
Acceptance of Privacy Policy By submitting your personal information to Skep, you signify your consent to the collection, use
and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not
consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with
this Privacy Policy, do not provide your personal information to Skep. Of course, certain services
can only be offered to you if you provide personal information to Skep, and therefore Skep may
not be able to offer you those services if you choose not to provide it with required personal information.
Personal information
PIPEDA defines "personal information" broadly as any information about an identifiable individual. 
Generally speaking, personal information does not include "business contact information" such as the name, job title, business address, or business telephone number of an employee of an organization.
Consent
Skep obtains your consent before it collects, uses, or discloses your personal information.
Normally, Skep asks for your consent in writing, but in some circumstances, it may accept your oral consent. Sometimes, your consent may be implied through your conduct with Skep.
Subject to legal and contractual requirements and reasonable notice, you may refuse or withdraw your consent to certain of the identified purposes at any time by contacting Skep's
Privacy Officer (see the end of this Privacy Policy for contact information). The period of
reasonable notice will vary depending on the nature of the information and its purpose.
If you provide Skep or its service providers and agents with personal information of another
individual, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary authority and/or have obtained
all necessary consents from such person to enable Skep to collect, use and disclose such personal
information for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy.
There may be circumstances where you have provided personal information for an identified
purpose, and Skep later needs to use that information for a different purpose. In such
circumstances, Skep will seek your consent to use the information for the new purpose.
Why Skep collects, uses and discloses your personal information

        of the communications. Skep may also use this information for customer support services

        Skep collects and uses information to enable reliable and convenient [third party] services and
        other related products and services. Skep collects, uses and discloses your personal information

        Skep may also ask for and collect your personal information at certain points throughout the
        services it provides. In addition to the information you knowingly provide, Skep collects the
        domain names and IP addresses of its visitors, along with usage statistics (e.g., types of web
        browsers and operating systems used) and browsing history. This data is used to more efficiently
        operate Skep's business and to promote and administer our services. As well, Skep collects any
        information you may choose to provide in your communications with us.
        How Skep collects, uses and discloses your personal information
        Skep collects your personal information by fair and lawful means and, wherever appropriate,
        directly from you. Wherever possible, Skep limits the amount of personal information it collects,
        uses or discloses to that necessary and appropriate to provide its services and to operate Skep's
        business. Skep does not sell or share your personal information to third parties for third party
        direct marketing purposes. Skep uses the information for the various purposes, including:
        1. Providing Services and Features to Your Account
        Skep uses the information it collects to provide, personalize, maintain and improve its products
        and services. This includes using the information to:
        • Verify your identity.
        • Create and update your account.
        • To enable third party services to be transacted.
        • Process or facilitate payments for those third party services.
        • To track progress or status of the third party services.
        • Enable features that allows you to personalize your Skep account or to share your

        • Perform internal operations necessary to provide our services, including to troubleshoot
        software bugs and operational problems, to conduct data analysis, testing, and research,
        and to monitor and analyze usage and activity trends.
        2. Communications between Users
        Skep uses the information it collects to enable communications between its users. For example,
        a cleaning service provider may text or call to confirm a location for the cleaning services.
        3. Communications between Skep and Users
        Skep may use the information it collects to communicate with you about products, services,
        promotions, studies, surveys, news, updates and events.
        Skep may also use the information to promote and process contests and sweepstakes, fulfill any
        related awards, and serve you relevant ads and content about our services and those of our
        business partners. You may receive some of these communications based on your profile as a
        Skep user.
        Skep uses the information it collects (including recordings of customer support calls after
        providing notice to you and with your consent) to assist you when you contact our customer
        support services.
        Skep may use the information it collects for testing, research, analysis and product development.
        This allows us to improve and enhance the safety and security of our services, develop new
        features and products, and facilitate insurance and finance solutions in connection with our
        services.
        We use your data to help maintain the safety, security and integrity of our services and users.
        4. Legal Proceedings
        Skep may use the information it collects to investigate or address claims or disputes relating to
        your use of Skep's services, or as otherwise allowed by applicable law, or as requested by
        regulators, government entities, and official inquiries.
        When Skep discloses your personal information
        Skep discloses your personal information only as described in this Privacy Policy, with your
        consent, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. Under certain circumstances and
        consistent with PIPEDA, Skep will disclose your personal information, including:
        • if Skep engages a third party to provide administrative services to it (like computer backup services or archival file storage) and the third party is bound by this Privacy Policy;
        • when necessary to collect outstanding accounts;
        • with other users in accordance with the services we provide;
        • with our subsidiaries and affiliates to help us provide our services or conduct data
        processing on our behalf;
        • when necessary to comply with court orders, regulatory rules, or to satisfy Skep's
        insurance requirements;
        • to its vendors, consultants, marketing partners, research firms, and other service
        providers or business partners such as Stripe; and
        • when Skep reasonably believes that a third party requesting your personal information is
        your agent.
        Please note that there are circumstances where the use and/or disclosure of personal
        information may be justified or permitted or where Skep may or must disclose information
        without your consent, in accordance with applicable law. For example, Skep may disclose your
        personal information to a government institution that has asserted its lawful authority to obtain
        the information or where Skep has reasonable grounds to believe the information could be useful
        in the investigation of unlawful activity, or to comply with a subpoena or warrant or an order
        made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information, or to
        comply with court rules regarding the production of records and information, or to protect Skep's
        rights and property. Where obliged or permitted to disclose information without consent, Skep
        will not disclose more information than is required for the purpose that obligates or permits it to
        disclose such information.

        Disclosure of your personal information to third party service providers

        When Skep transfers your personal information to a third party to provide administrative and
        other services, it uses appropriate measures to ensure that the third party will only use your
        personal information to perform the services Skep has specified. The increasingly global nature
        of Skep's business sometimes requires it to use administrative service providers who may be
        located in the United States or elsewhere outside of Canada. Accordingly, your personal
        information may be transferred outside of Canada and if so, it will be subject to the legal
        requirements of the applicable foreign jurisdictions, including local requirements to disclose
        information to courts, law enforcement and national security authorities.
        To the extent Skep enters into arrangements with service providers, agents and contractors to
        store, handle or process personal information on its behalf, such as for data processing,
        document storage software support and office services, Skep's policy will be to require such
        parties by contractual or other means to provide comparable privacy protection while the
        information is processed or handled by them.

        Where Skep stores your personal information

        Your personal information is stored in secured locations and on servers controlled by Skep,
        located either at our offices or at the offices of our service providers. Your personal information
        may be processed, accessed and/or stored in Canada or another jurisdiction, and will be subject
        to the laws of that jurisdiction.

        Security of your personal information

        Skep uses commercially reasonable standard safeguards applicable to the technology services
        industry to protect the security of personal information in its possession, including physical,
        organizational and technological measures. These measures include:
        • premises security;
        • restricted access to files that contain personal information;
        • technological safeguards like security software and firewalls to prevent hacking or
        unauthorized computer access; and
        • internal password and security policies.
        However, no method of transmitting or storing information is completely secure. While Skep
        takes appropriate measures to protect your personal information, there is always a risk that it
        may be lost, intercepted or misused. Skep may exchange electronic versions of documents and
        e-mails with you using commercially available software that may be vulnerable to attack by
        viruses and other destructive electronic programs. Skep cannot guarantee that all
        communications and documents sent via e-mail will always be received, or that such
        communications and documents will always be virus free. Skep makes no warranty with respect
        to the integrity of any electronic communications between Skep and you or with respect to the
        security of any such communication and you consent to Skep's exchange of electronic
        communications, including confidential documents, unencrypted.

        Accessing your personal information

        You may ask for access to any personal information Skep holds about you. Summary information
        is available on request.
        Subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law, you will be given reasonable access to your
        personal information and will be entitled to challenge the accuracy and completeness of that
        information and, to the extent that you have proven such inaccuracy or incompleteness, have it
        amended as appropriate. Examples of such exceptions include information that is prohibitively
        costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that
        cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons, and information that
        is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.

        Updating the accuracy of your personal information

        You can help Skep maintain the accuracy of your personal information by notifying Skep of any
        changes to your personal information. If Skep holds information about you and you advise usthat
        it is not accurate, complete and up-to-date, Skep will take reasonable steps to correct it.

        Being denied access to your personal information

        Your rights to access your personal information are not absolute. Skep may deny access when:
        • denial of access is required or authorized by law;
        • information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings against you;
        • granting you access would have an unreasonable impact on other people's privacy;
        • protecting Skep's rights and property; and
        • your request is frivolous or vexatious.
        If Skep denies your request for access to your personal information, or refuses a request to
        correct information, Skep will explain why.

        Personal information

        Cookies

        We and our partners may use cookies and other identification technologies on our apps,
        websites, emails, and online ads for purposes described in this policy. Cookies are small text files
        that are stored on your browser or device by websites, apps, online media, and
        advertisements. Skep uses cookies and similar technologies for purposes such as authenticating
        users, remembering user preferences and setting, monitoring and analyzing site traffic and
        trends.
        The use of cookie technology is common on the Internet, and many Internet browsers are initially
        set to accept cookies automatically.
        If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your Internet browser to notify you when
        your computer is receiving a cookie or to refuse cookies automatically. To readjust your Internet
        browser’s cookie options, please refer to the instruction documentation of your particular
        browser or seek online assistance.
        Through the use of our services and site we may make use of "per session" and "persistent"
        cookie technology. Per session cookies track information during an open session and are stored
        only temporarily in your computer’s memory. Persistent cookies are deposited on a visitor's
        computer until they expire or until the visitor deletes the cookies. Information from these cookies
        help Skep analyze traffic patterns to the site, including the total number of visitors, the
        geographical location of the visitor, and the types of Internet browsers (e.g., Google Chrome or
        Internet Explorer) and operating systems (e.g., Windows or Macintosh) that the site's visitors use.
        Skep uses this information to facilitate and enhance your online visits. Skep does not crossreference this information with any type of personal information that is voluntarily offered by
        you.

        Traffic patterns

        Monitoring and managing site traffic patterns, usage and related site information is done in order
        to optimise its web service. Skep may provide aggregated information to third parties, but these
        statistics do not include any personal information.

        Tracking information

        In addition, Skep may use non-personal information to create aggregate tracking information
        reports regarding user demographics and traffic patterns. None of the tracking information in the
        reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users. Skep
        also may link tracking information with Website users' personal information. Once such a link is
        made, all of the linked information is treated as personal information and will be used and
        disclosed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and in accordance with the law.

        Links

        Any use of the Skep's apps, site or services may present links to other websites. You should be
        aware that operators of linked websites may also collect your personal information and
        information generated through the use of cookies when you link to their websites. Skep is not
        responsible for how such third parties collect, use or disclose your personal information, so it is
        important to review their privacy policies before providing them with your personal information.

        Serious privacy breach notifications

        Skep will notify you of any breach of the security safeguards involving your personal information
        under Skep's control if it is reasonable in the circumstances to believe that the breach creates a
        real risk of significant harm to you (a "Serious Privacy Breach"). This notice will be conspicuous
        and given to you in the manner prescribed under PIPEDA as soon as feasible after Skep
        determines that such a breach has occurred.
        Likewise, Skep will report any Serious Privacy Breach to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner
        of Canada in the manner prescribed under PIPEDA as soon as feasible after Skep determines that
        such a breach has occurred.

        Changes to Privacy Policy

        Privacy laws are rapidly evolving and, as a result, Skep reserves the right to change this Privacy
        Policy without notice and at any time. The most current version of this Privacy Policy is posted
        on the Website. Regardless of any changes Skep makes to this Privacy Policy, Skep will only use
        your personal information in accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy in place at the
        time you provided your information, or as otherwise required or permitted by law, unless you
        have given your express consent for Skep to do otherwise.
